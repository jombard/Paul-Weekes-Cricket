			<h2>Paul Weekes</h2>
			<h3>Middlesex CCC, England A</h3>
				<p>Paul Weekes, or &#34;Weekesy&#34;, as he is affectionately known, made his debut for Middlesex County Cricket Club in 1990. He embarked on a 16 year career in first class cricket and holds the record of being the only English player to score more than 150 runs in both innings of a first class game. His effective right-arm off-spin was also called upon with over 300 first class wickets to his name.</p>
				<p>Weekesy had a stint with England A on tours to Bangladesh and India in 1994 and took two important catches for England as a substitute fielder in 1995 against West Indies.</p>

			<h3>Coaching Career</h3>
				<p>Weekesy has now been coaching for over 25 years. He is co-founder of the <a href="coaching.html">WK cricket academy</a> and is also the head coach at a prestigious school in London.</p>
		<div class="nextsection"></div>
			<h3>Younger Days</h3>
				<p>Cricket was a major influence as Weekesy was growing up with several brothers that were all influenced by their West Indian father. Often being dragged to matches, it wasn't long before they joined the local West Indian League in Hackney. As they got older they formed their own side called East London Youth which consisted of Weekesy, his 6 brothers and their father.</p>
				<p>At the age of 19, after a stint with the Young Professionals at Lords, Weekesy was fortunate enough to travel to Australia to broaden his cricket education. On the recommendation of then English captain, Mike Gatting, Weekesy was flown out to the University of Newcastle in Australia. After a succesful trip, he returned to London and broke into the Middlesex 1st XI and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
